# Merkle Forest : A zk-friendly Elastic Group Design

## Abstract


## Motivation

Binary Increamental Merkle Tree, With Fixed-size Depth(Gurantee), is generally used as Group. The navitve way to prove group membership, is verify merkle path in zk-cirucit, which means circuit is coupled with the tree depth. 

obviously, the exist circuit cannot be reused if user want a higher Gurantee.

Suppose the below sceniors:
1. User have a group of grantee 10, and it's almost full. user want to enlarge the group, but have to create a new group, and ask member to rejoin.
2. User want to create a group, but can't decide the gurantee yet, it will depand on how the bussiness going. Becouse of above 1, the only chocie is choose the maxium possible gurantee. even at the beginning, when the member small size, still have to generate full merkle path proof, result in non-efficent cost for both prover and on-chain verify.
3. [Optional] User may join and leave group frenquently, suppose totolly 1 million join/leave, even though the total members at any time never exceed 1024, a group with grantee > 20 is still needed.

so we can get a conclusion : fixed-size merkle tree can not meet the variety/dynamic user demands for group memebership.

Let's return back to the 1st demand, and think more fine-graind about the "grantee", it can be defined as the probability of member can be exposed in group, suppose grantee=10, then the group size will be 2**10 = 1024, the memeber have 1/1024 probability been recorgnized. for grantee=20, the probability is ~1/1million.

Does user really need such a low probability, maybe yes for some case, maybe not neccearry for other case.
For the later case, user actually need
1. acceptable grantee, for privacy protect
2. max group size, which limit the join behaviour

So Here We propose "Merkle Forest" to represent the "max group size", to provide elastic group design.
* "Combine multiple reuseable merkle tree" as the group.
* provide a way for each member to join a specific merkle tree

Now, we reduce the huge-MT prove issue to
* small-MT prove
* lookup issue.

we will find that, this kind of reduce will provide scalable group membership, and many following benefits, and on the other side, privacy decreaseï¼Œ which is acceptable in practicial case.


## Definitions

* [identity](https://semaphore.appliedzkp.org/docs/guides/identities) : a big number on behalf of member
* Group : a group for member join, and prove the membership.
* Gurantee : group capability, support gurantee=10, group can have maxium 2^10 member to join
* Group Membership : prove member exist in group, usally by it's merkle path.
* EG : Elastic Group, whose size dynamic growth.

## Specification

We Propose Merkle Forest, using sharding of multi smaller group, instead of single huge group.
    1. decouple the circuit size from Gurantee.
    2. Group Size = 2^Gurantee = 2^H * 2^(G - H) = 2^H * K, K = 2^(G-H)

also some other advantage:
1. heavy trust setup for zkey (TODO : data, depth-20 need 2 hours on macbook pro). very big zkey file, become experience if user have to download for proof generate local.
2. inifinte group
3. build circuit themself.

more important is , Merkle tree itself not scalable, there is no way to enlarge exist group(new circuit for new MT),  such as infinite group demands.

ZK using merkle path to prove the group membership, so the circuit size is related(linear) to Group Gurantee. 

Server issues exist for the single MT Group:
* prover cost 
* 2. prover time growth (linear??) with Gurantee.
* 3. onchain gas cost increase(linearly) for group operation(insert..)
* 4. concurrency competition issue when multi user join the single group
    (1) reorder tx by relay, not native

decouple , only 1 trust setup, scalable.

## Interface

### Create Group  

```shell
    function createGroup(
        uint tree_depth,
        uint gurantee,
        uint zeroValue)
```

creates a new EG, with user-provided anonymity guarantee, for example, if the user set the anonymity guarantee to be 10, then the shard size of this EAS is 2
10 = 1024, which means this EAS has 1/1024 anonymity.

Privacy Level : real gurantee.


if user don't give gurantee, infinite 

dynamic growth

underline
* increamental MT 
* sparse MT

### Join Group

```shell
    function insert(
        uint256 groupId,
        uint256 identity)
```

Group Growth Strategy
* Dynamic Growth

* Sequencial
* Random
    Hashed :  less shard expose , auto reorgnize.  re-blance. (tree split, no 2 different group)

### Membership Prove

```shell
    function contains(
        uint256 groupId,
        uint256 identity,
        uint256[] calldata proofSiblings,
        uint8[] calldata proofPathIndices)
```

cost reduce
* prover cost
* gas cost



### Leave Group(optional)

```shell
    function remove(
        uint256 groupId,
        uint256 identity,
        uint256[] calldata proofSiblings,
        uint8[] calldata proofPathIndices)
```


* Privacy Leave
* Public Leave

### Group Gurantee Change

Elastic Group

```shell
    function enlargeGroup(uint groupId, uint gurantee)
    function downsizeGroup(uint groupId, uint gurantee)
```

increase/decrese group gurantee, group admin operation.
decrese only success if group's member number not exceed the new gurantee.


### migrate exist group

exist group as 1 MT of the MT Forest.

problem is 

gas limit

### Composable/CP-Snark(optional)

CP-SNARK and -> or ?
